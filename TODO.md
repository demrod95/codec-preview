Codec Preview's Todo List:

* [ ] add mjpeg command (currently it is a h265 command, lol)
* [ ] add getCodec(), getFormat(), getCodecParameters() methods
* [ ] make swapping between files and between camera and files work properly
* [ ] split codeccomparisonwindow into multiple classes, make it less of a god class
* [x] make local video files streamed to the network and read from there
* [x] finish broadcast method and make it universal for streaming from ffmpeg command
* [x] clang-format the code
* [x] make CodecTab to inherit QWidget
