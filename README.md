# Codec Preview
Codec Preview is a project thats aims at providing you an educational tool for comparison of video codecs. It allows for playback from a webcam or video file that is encoded in real time. Encoding parameters can be changed on the fly and video statistics can be easily observed and analyzed.

The project makes use of Qt 5.8 and ffmpeg encoding tools.

You can download example MJPEG-encoded video files from [codec-preview-media](https://github.com/gorge-raccoon/codec-preview-media).
